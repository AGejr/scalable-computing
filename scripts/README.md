# Scripts

**How to make it work?:**
- Run on VM that has access to everything on GCP
- VM should be based on service-account
- Service-account should be created in IAM
- Service accounts should have access to "Editor" and "Secret Manager Secret Accessor"
- In Secret Manager, insert service-account key and Kaggle API key
- Kaggle uses my personal API
